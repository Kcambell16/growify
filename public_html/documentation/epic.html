         <h2>Persona #1</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Alice Johnson, age 32</li>

            <li>It is early February, and Alice wants to start a vegetable garden with her 4 year old daughter. She has no experience with
               planting a garden, so she is looking for resources to help her plan.</li>

            <li>Profession: Customer Service Representative</li>

            <li>Technology: Alice has an Android phone, PC, and Kindle. She is tech savvy and enjoys using her devices to make her life easier.</li>

            <li>Attitudes and Behaviors: Alice is enthusiastic about starting her garden and wants to get a good plan in place before starting.
               She is short on time, so she is looking for quick and easy ways to start her garden.</li>

            <li>Frustrations and Needs:
               Alice wants to create a small garden and would like her daughter to get involved with the process. She needs to select easy to grow
               plants that don't need a lot of maintenance. In her backyard, she has a medium-sized garden box with plenty of direct sunlight. She
               will need to be strategic in selecting the right herbs and vegetables since they will all be planted in one garden box.
            </li>
            <li>Goals:
               Alice wants to figure out --
               <ul>
                  <li>when she should begin planting</li>
                  <li>what group of herbs and vegetables grow well together</li>
                  <li>how to maintain her garden</li>
                  <li>when she should harvest</li>
               </ul>
            <li> Use Case:
               Alice finds the Growify app on her Android phone. She downloads it and begins to scroll through the various choices of plants to
               grow. She has 3 top vegetables she would like to grow and finds them in the app database. She sees which ones grow well together
               and finalizes her list. She finds out when she can start planting and goes out to buy the seed packets necessary to make this garden
               happen.</li>
