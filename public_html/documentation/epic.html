         <h1>Executive Summary </h1>
            <div>
               Growify is an application that offers gardeners suggestions based on current and historical weather data as well as local climate
               and growing conditions. Gardeners will also receive tailored data based on their own list of herbs and vegetables.

         <h1>Personas</h1>
         <h2>Persona #1</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Alice Johnson, age 32</li>

            <li>It is early February, and Alice wants to start a vegetable garden with her 4 year old daughter. She has no experience with
               planting a garden, so she is looking for resources to help her plan.</li>

            <li>Profession: Customer Service Representative</li>

            <li>Technology: Alice has an Android phone, PC, and Kindle. She is tech savvy and enjoys using her devices to make her life easier.</li>

            <li>Attitudes and Behaviors: Alice is enthusiastic about starting her garden and wants to get a good plan in place before starting.
               She is short on time, so she is looking for quick and easy ways to start her garden.</li>

            <li>Frustrations and Needs:
               Alice wants to create a small garden and would like her daughter to get involved with the process. She needs to select easy to grow
               plants that don't need a lot of maintenance. In her backyard, she has a medium-sized garden box with plenty of direct sunlight. She
               will need to be strategic in selecting the right herbs and vegetables since they will all be planted in one garden box.
            </li>
            <li>Goals:
               Alice wants to figure out --
               <ul>
                  <li>when she should begin planting</li>
                  <li>what group of herbs and vegetables grow well together</li>
                  <li>how to maintain her garden</li>
                  <li>when she should harvest</li>

               </ul>
            <li> Use Case:
               Alice finds the Growify app on her Android phone. She downloads it and begins to scroll through the various choices of plants to
               grow. She has 3 top vegetables she would like to grow and finds them in the app database. She sees which ones grow well together
               and finalizes her list. She finds out when she can start planting and goes out to buy the seed packets necessary to make this garden
               happen.</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>User Stories:</h2>

				<h2>Persona 2</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Name:</strong> Shiloh Ezra</li>
					<li><strong>Age:</strong> 28</li>
					<li><strong>Profession:</strong> Instagram Food Blogger</li>
					<li><strong>Technology:</strong> Shiloh has a Microsoft Kin (the most hipster of phones) and a Lenovo Thinkpad running Gentoo Linux. He uses Opera to browse the web.</li>
					<li><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> March has just begun and Shiloh wants to plant an herb garden for his artisanal herbed goat cheese. He has a fair amount of experience when it comes to growing his herbs, but is always open to new ideas that might improve his yield. Shiloh has already chosen the herbs that he wants to plant. He has spent a lot of time researching their flavor profiles and is confident in his choices. He is very meticulous in his research and may not be keen on using a new resource (our site) that he is unsure of.</li>
					<li><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Shiloh gets frustrated with using web apps that are difficult to navigate or have a cluttered interface. He needs a fairly minimalistic user interface to be comfortable.</li>
					<li><strong>Goals:</strong> Shiloh want to learn, at the very least --
						<ul>
							<li>if certain herbs would benefit from sprouting indoors </li>
							<li>would certain herbs be beneficial to grow with others</li>
							<li>if the weather will make watering unnecessary on certain days</li>
						</ul>
					<li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Shiloh is preparing for spring planting but wants to get some quick research in. Through a quick search on DuckDuckGo, he finds Growify.io and is convinced it is "the bee's knees"(his words, not mine). He creates a new user profile, and after a brief questionnaire, is immediately assaulted with information on optimal growing conditions for herbs tailored to his preferences. Comforted by the abundance of information readily available and the tastefully minimalistic user interface, he settles into his research and prepares for the upcoming planting.</li>

         <h2>Persona 3</h2>
            <ul>
               <li> <strong>Name</strong>: Mildred McCormick</li>
               <li> <strong>Age</strong>: 59</li>
               <li> <strong>Profession</strong>: Retired on April 19, 2015</li>
               <li> <strong>Technology</strong>:
               <ul>
                  <li>HP EliteOne 705 G2 23-inch Touch All-in-One PC, runs windows 10. She uses it to browse facebook to catch up with her old friends, Betty and Ruth, google recipes, and check up on all the latest most reliable news from her favorite source, yahoo and msn</li>
                  <li>Iphone 3GS, mainly uses it to call her children and grandchildren. Yahoo and MSN send her alerts but she doesnt like to "press on them" because they take her to safari with 100's of open windows. She doesn't know how to close the windows and feels disorganized when she uses her iphone to browse the internet.</li>
                  <li>She also uses her Iphone 3GS to check the weather app, which will let her know how much she needs to water plants in her garden</li>
               </ul>
               <li><strong>Hobbies/Interests</strong>
               <ul>
                  <li>Crotchet</li>
                  <li>Playing the Violin, however arthritis has really started to bother her while playing.</li>
                  <li><strong>Gardening</strong>. Mildred has been gardening ever since she got her grandchildren to dig up a plot in her backyard in 2009. She started off growing a few different plants for gardening novices (mainly rooted plants) such as: 'green leaf' lettuce, Tomatoes, Cucumber, Carrots, Radishes, Green Beans, and Zucchini. In 2013, she started becoming more artistic with gardening, as she moved focus towards gardening as arthritis prevented her from playing violin. She started growing flowers such as Marigolds, Zinnia, Monte Carlo Amaryllis, Petunias, Gomphrena, Impatiens,  and Dianthus. She also started growing herbs such as Basil, Catnip (for her cat Senator Cretak), Chamomite, Coriander, and Cilantro.</li>
               </ul>
               <li>Upcoming Needs/Goals
                  <ul>
                     <li>Mildred has cleared her schedule in the beginning of Spring because she is planning on her best garden yields ever. She wants to try growing some plants she has yet to grow, and needs to know what kind of soil, how much watering will be needed, how much sunlight will be necessary, and whether or not she will be needing to use a greenhouse (that her husband Reginald McCormick can begrungingly install) next spring to make sure the amount of heat and humidity are up to her standards to grow an impressive yield and have the most impressive garden in her Crotchet group. She needs to find a decent farmers almanac that will provide information clearly and easily. She would also like to research what kind of plants would be best for this season, as well has how to grow significant yields of her favorite plants to grow, and if these plants will be compatible to grow next to each other in the first place. </li>
                     <li><strong>Summary of Mildred's Goals</strong>
                        <ul>
                           <li>What kinds of new plants she can grow</li>
                           <li>What is the best way to increase yields from plants she has intermediate experience growing.</li>
                           <li>Will a greenhouse be necessary to control humidity and temperature of her chosen plants or if her current climate and weather will be neccessary</li>
                           <li>Weather information tailored to her position that she can use to see how rain/sunlight will effect how she tends to her crops.</li>
                        </ul>
                  </ul>
               <li><strong>Use Case for Mildred</strong>
               <ol>
		<li>Mildred needs an application that lets her know how much water to feed her plants, how much space each garden plant needs, and how much sun each plant needs. Along with this she needs to know what time of year she should grow her plants.</li>
            </ul>
