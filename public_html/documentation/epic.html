			<h1>Personas</h1>
			<h2>Persona #1</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Alice Johnson, age 32</li>

				<li>It is early February, and Alice wants to start a vegetable garden with her 4 year old daughter. She has
					no experience with
					planting a garden, so she is looking for resources to help her plan.
				</li>

				<li>Profession: Customer Service Representative</li>

				<li>Technology: Alice has an Android phone, PC, and Kindle. She is tech savvy and enjoys using her devices
					to make her life easier.
				</li>

				<li>Attitudes and Behaviors: Alice is enthusiastic about starting her garden and wants to get a good plan in
					place before starting.
					She is short on time, so she is looking for quick and easy ways to start her garden.
				</li>

				<li>Frustrations and Needs:
					Alice wants to create a small garden and would like her daughter to get involved with the process. She
					needs to select easy to grow
					plants that don't need a lot of maintenance. In her backyard, she has a medium-sized garden box with
					plenty of direct sunlight. She
					will need to be strategic in selecting the right herbs and vegetables since they will all be planted in
					one garden box.
				</li>
				<li>Goals:
					Alice wants to figure out --
					<ul>
						<li>when she should begin planting</li>
						<li>what group of herbs and vegetables grow well together</li>
						<li>how to maintain her garden</li>
						<li>when she should harvest</li>

					</ul>
				<li> Use Case:
					Alice finds the Growify app on her Android phone. She downloads it and begins to scroll through the
					various choices of plants to
					grow. She has 3 top vegetables she would like to grow and finds them in the app database. She sees which
					ones grow well together
					and finalizes her list. She finds out when she can start planting and goes out to buy the seed packets
					necessary to make this garden
					happen.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Persona 2</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Name</strong>: Mildred McCormick</li>
				<li><strong>Age</strong>: 59</li>
				<li><strong>Profession</strong>: Retired on April 19, 2015</li>
				<li><strong>Technology</strong>:
					<ul>
						<li>HP EliteOne 705 G2 23-inch Touch All-in-One PC, runs windows 10. She uses it to browse facebook to
							catch up with her old friends, Betty and Ruth, google recipes, and check up on all the latest most
							reliable news from her favorite source, yahoo and msn
						</li>
						<li>Iphone 3GS, mainly uses it to call her children and grandchildren. Yahoo and MSN send her alerts
							but she doesnt like to "press on them" because they take her to safari with 100's of open windows.
							She doesn't know how to close the windows and feels disorganized when she uses her iphone to browse
							the internet.
						</li>
						<li>She also uses her Iphone 3GS to check the weather app, which will let her know how much she needs
							to water plants in her garden
						</li>
					</ul>
				<li><strong>Hobbies/Interests</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Crotchet</li>
						<li>Playing the Violin, however arthritis has really started to bother her while playing.</li>
						<li><strong>Gardening</strong>. Mildred has been gardening ever since she got her grandchildren to dig
							up a plot in her backyard in 2009. She started off growing a few different plants for gardening
							novices (mainly rooted plants) such as: 'green leaf' lettuce, Tomatoes, Cucumber, Carrots,
							Radishes, Green Beans, and Zucchini. In 2013, she started becoming more artistic with gardening, as
							she moved focus towards gardening as arthritis prevented her from playing violin. She started
							growing flowers such as Marigolds, Zinnia, Monte Carlo Amaryllis, Petunias, Gomphrena, Impatiens,
							and Dianthus. She also started growing herbs such as Basil, Catnip (for her cat Senator Cretak),
							Chamomite, Coriander, and Cilantro.
						</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Upcoming Needs/Goals
					<ul>
						<li>Mildred has cleared her schedule in the beginning of Spring because she is planning on her best
							garden yields ever. She wants to try growing some plants she has yet to grow, and needs to know
							what kind of soil, how much watering will be needed, how much sunlight will be necessary, and
							whether or not she will be needing to use a greenhouse (that her husband Reginald McCormick can
							begrungingly install) next spring to make sure the amount of heat and humidity are up to her
							standards to grow an impressive yield and have the most impressive garden in her Crotchet group.
							She needs to find a decent farmers almanac that will provide information clearly and easily. She
							would also like to research what kind of plants would be best for this season, as well has how to
							grow significant yields of her favorite plants to grow, and if these plants will be compatible to
							grow next to each other in the first place.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Summary of Mildred's Goals</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>What kinds of new plants she can grow</li>
								<li>What is the best way to increase yields from plants she has intermediate experience
									growing.
								</li>
								<li>Will a greenhouse be necessary to control humidity and temperature of her chosen plants or
									if her current climate and weather will be neccessary
								</li>
								<li>Weather information tailored to her position that she can use to see how rain/sunlight will
									effect how she tends to her crops.
								</li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				<li><strong>Use Case for Mildred</strong>
				<li>Mildred needs an application that lets her know how much water to feed her plants, how much space each
					garden plant needs, and how much sun each plant needs. Along with this she needs to know what time of
					year she should grow her plants. She would like to use something with a user interface with as little
					clicks as possible, something that is very easy to use for those not familiar with using hard-to-use
					features. She wants a very minimalist GUI
